# Hello!
## This is the repo for the browser proxy HuopaProxy

You can use this in projects of your's, though I do remind you that right now this is quite buggy.

### Install
- Install "express", "node-fetch" and "cheerio" using a package manager of your choice (NPM is stable)
- Change the server URL in the server script to something like localhost:3000
- Run the server script
- Open the client HTML file
