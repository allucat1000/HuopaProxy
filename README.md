# Hello!
## This is the repo for the browser proxy HuopaProxy

You can use this in projects of your's, though I do remind you that right now this is quite buggy.

### Install
- Install [Deno](<https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/>)
- Install "express", "express-rate-limit", "tough-cookie", "fetch-cookie", "es-module-lexer" and "cheerio" using NPM
- Get the server.js and index.html files
- Change the server URL in the server script and client file to something like localhost:3000
- Start the server using "deno --allow-env --unstable-kv --allow-net server.js"
- Open the client HTML file
